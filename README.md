## Overview

Welcome to Kenzieâ€™s Park! In this project, I built a dynamic and responsive webpage where I had full control over the design, layout, and content of this page. This project helped me practice responsive web design principles and showcase my creativity.

## Project Requirements

1. **Page Content:**
   - Create a webpage, which can be based on an existing organization or a made-up one.
   - Customize the club name, page layout, styling, and images to fit your vision.

2. **Responsive Design:**
   - Demonstrate responsive design techniques learned from the course. The page should adjust dynamically as the screen size changes.
   - Use relative units like percentages, em, and rem to size and position elements.

3. **Media Queries:**
   - Implement media queries to adjust the layout and behaviour of the page based on different screen sizes and breakpoints.

4. **Images:**
   - Include images in your design. 

## Design Guidelines

- **Layout and Styling:**
  - Choose a layout that adapts well to various screen sizes. For example, use percentages for widths and responsive units like em and rem for font sizes and spacing.
  - Implement media queries to alter the page layout at different breakpoints, ensuring a seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

- **Responsive Elements:**
  - Make images responsive by setting the width to a percentage of the container, ensuring they scale properly with the viewport size.
  - Adjust text sizes and element spacing using relative units to maintain readability and aesthetic balance across devices.

## Solution

The full code for the example site is available in the solution section at the end of this project. Use it as a reference to understand how responsive design principles are applied.

Happy coding, and enjoy building your dynamic club group page!
